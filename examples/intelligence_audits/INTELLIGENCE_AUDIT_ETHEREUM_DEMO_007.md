## Methodology

**Intelligence Collection:** Automated intake, fusion, behavioral analysis

**Analysis Frameworks:**
- **HADES:** Profiling/risk scoring for multi-chain operations
- **ECHO:** Network detection for cross-chain coordination
- **NEMESIS:** Forecasting for chain-agnostic threat assessment

**Compilation Timeline:**
- **Start:** 2025-12-08T14:30:00Z
- **Data Aggregation:** <500ms (automated)
- **Pattern Analysis:** <2 seconds (ML-based)
- **Risk Scoring:** <1 second (algorithmic)
- **Total Automated Processing:** <5 seconds

**Note:** Automated compilation provides rapid pattern detection and risk scoring. Human analyst review recommended for strategic decisions. Traditional manual analysis (14+ days) provides contextual judgment that complements automated compilation.

**Data Sources:**
- Public blockchain intelligence
- Multi-chain coordination patterns
- Ethereum network analysis
- EVM-compatible chain data

**Confidence Score Methodology:**

Confidence scores represent ABC's algorithmic assessment based on:

1. **Data Quality** (0-100%): Completeness and reliability of source data
2. **Pattern Match** (0-100%): Strength of behavioral signature match
3. **Source Diversity** (0-100%): Number of independent data sources
4. **Historical Validation** (0-100%): Past accuracy of similar compilations

**Formula:** Confidence = (Data Quality × 0.3) + (Pattern Match × 0.4) + (Source Diversity × 0.2) + (Historical Validation × 0.1)

**Example - Chain-Agnostic Architecture: 92% confidence**
- Data Quality: 95% (robust blockchain data)
- Pattern Match: 92% (strong signature match)
- Source Diversity: 88% (Ethereum, multi-chain data)
- Historical Validation: 90% (validated against known patterns)

**Note:** These are algorithmic confidence scores, not statistical confidence intervals. Full methodology available upon request.
