**Confidence Score Methodology:**

Confidence scores represent ABC's algorithmic assessment based on:

1. **Data Quality** (0-100%): Completeness and reliability of source data
2. **Pattern Match** (0-100%): Strength of behavioral signature match
3. **Source Diversity** (0-100%): Number of independent data sources
4. **Historical Validation** (0-100%): Past accuracy of similar compilations

**Formula:** Confidence = (Data Quality × 0.3) + (Pattern Match × 0.4) + (Source Diversity × 0.2) + (Historical Validation × 0.1)

**Example - Critical Mineral Vulnerabilities: 88% confidence**
- Data Quality: 90% (robust public supply chain data)
- Pattern Match: 88% (strong signature match)
- Source Diversity: 85% (industry reports, economic intelligence, mapping data)
