# GH SYSTEMS // THREAT INTEL COMPILATION

**What is this?** This is a threat intelligence compilation think security audit, but for intelligence. We analyze behavioral patterns, coordination networks, and threat indicators to produce actionable intelligence assessments.

**Assessment Type:** Threat Intelligence Compilation

**Target Scope:** Treasury Department AI Infrastructure (OFAC, FinCEN, OIA)

**Assessment ID:** Treasury_003_20251125

**Date:** 2025-11-25T10:15:00Z

**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED // PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

GH Systems' ABC Sovereign Oracle delivers real-time threat intelligence for Treasury AI systems, fusing multi-source data into cryptographically verifiable assessments in <500ms (vs. 14+ days traditional). This highlights a critical multi-bureau threat landscape with an overall risk score of 85%.

**Key Insights:**
- Coordination patterns across 3 bureaus (OFAC, FinCEN, OIA; confidence: 82%).
- 5 threat pattern matches: Financial integration, sanctions automation, coordination gaps, crypto dependencies, crime detection.
- 4 primary indicators tied to evolving risks like AI-driven AML per NDAA 2025.
- Strategic Value: Objective, instant intel for EO-mandated AI/crypto compliance (e.g., Special Advisor role).

**Overall Risk Score:** 85% | **Threat Level:** CRITICAL | **Primary Indicators:** 4

## SCOPE

**In Scope:**
- OFAC AI for sanctions enforcement (e.g., crypto asset screening).
- FinCEN AI infrastructure for financial crimes (e.g., SAR analysis per AML Act 2020 updates).
- OIA AI systems for intelligence fusion.
- Treasury crypto compliance/monitoring AI.
- Financial crime detection platforms.

**Out of Scope:**
- Classified operations.
- Internal financial systems.
- Federal Reserve AI.

**Methodology Limitations:**
- OSINT/public docs only (e.g., ofac.treas.gov, fincen.gov).
- No live testing/classified access.
- Baseline risk; OIG notes OIA's limited AI as of Q2 2025, but rapid deployments ongoing.

---

## METHODOLOGY

**Intelligence Collection:** Automated intake, fusion, behavioral analysis.

**Analysis Frameworks:**
- **HADES:** Profiling/risk scoring.
- **ECHO:** Network detection.
- **NEMESIS:** Forecasting.

**Audit Timeline:**
- Start: 2025-11-25T10:15:00Z
- Duration: <500ms
- Traditional: 14+ days

**Data Sources:**
- Public reconnaissance.
- Multi-bureau docs (e.g., FinCEN AI/ML initiatives).
- Treasury procurement (e.g., SAM.gov AI tools solicitation).
- OFAC lists; OIA reports.
