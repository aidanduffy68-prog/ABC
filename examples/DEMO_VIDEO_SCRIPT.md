# ABC Demo Video Script: Built on Palantir Foundry

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Government agencies, intelligence contractors, Foundry customers  
**Tone:** Professional, technical, results-driven

---

## Opening (0:00 - 0:15)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - Foundry workspace on left, ABC compilation on right]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer. GH Systems ABC solves that—built natively on Palantir Foundry."

**[VISUAL: Fade to ABC logo with Foundry badge]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "ABC: The sovereign oracle for intelligence verification. Cryptographically verifiable threat assessments in under 500 milliseconds."

---

## Problem Statement (0:15 - 0:30)

**[VISUAL: Animated timeline showing 14+ days vs <500ms]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Traditional intelligence compilation takes 14 days. Multiple analysts. Subjective assessments. No cryptographic proof."

**[VISUAL: Split screen - Traditional workflow vs ABC]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "ABC compiles the same intelligence in under 500 milliseconds. With cryptographic verification. On Palantir Foundry."

## Foundry Integration Demo (0:30 - 1:15)

**[VISUAL: Foundry workspace with ABC dataset visible]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "ABC runs natively on Foundry. Your intelligence data lives in Foundry datasets. ABC compiles it. Foundry visualizes it."

**[VISUAL: Terminal/CLI showing compilation command]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Let's compile a threat assessment for Treasury Department AI infrastructure."

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Terminal]**

```bash
python scripts/compile_intelligence.py \
  --mode federal_ai \
  --target Treasury \
  --foundry-push
```

**[VISUAL: Compilation output showing <500ms]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Compilation complete. 485 milliseconds. Risk score: 85%. Cryptographically verified."

**[VISUAL: Foundry workspace showing compiled intelligence]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "The compiled intelligence automatically appears in your Foundry workspace. Ready for analysis, visualization, and operational use."

## Key Features (1:15 - 1:45)

**[VISUAL: Three-column layout]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Three core capabilities:"

**[VISUAL: HADES behavioral profiling animation]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "HADES: Behavioral profiling. Identifies threat patterns from transaction history and intelligence feeds."

**[VISUAL: ECHO network graph visualization]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "ECHO: Coordination detection. Maps relationships between threat actors, partners, and facilitators."

**[VISUAL: NEMESIS threat forecast timeline]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "NEMESIS: Predictive forecasting. Generates actionable targeting packages with confidence scores."

---

## Foundry Export Formats (1:45 - 2:00)

**[VISUAL: Foundry dataset with multiple export formats]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "ABC exports to Foundry in multiple formats: JSON for real-time feeds, CSV for analysis, Parquet for large-scale processing."

**[SCREEN RECORDING: Foundry dataset view]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "All data is schema-validated and ready for Foundry's data pipelines."

---

## Real-World Example (2:00 - 2:30)

**[VISUAL: Department of War assessment results]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Our first demonstration: Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure."

**[VISUAL: Risk score breakdown chart]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "88% risk score. Three threat indicators identified. Coordination patterns across three systems. Hash verified."

**[VISUAL: Cryptographic receipt display]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Every assessment includes a cryptographic receipt. SHA-256 hash. Verifiable proof of methodology. No disputes. No ambiguity."

---

## Closing (2:30 - 2:45)

**[VISUAL: Foundry workspace with ABC integration]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "ABC: Truth verification for post-AGI intelligence. Built on Palantir Foundry."

**[VISUAL: Contact information]**

**NARRATOR:**
> "Learn more at github.com/aidanduffy68-prog/ABC. Built on Palantir Foundry."

**[VISUAL: Final logo with tagline]**

**NARRATOR:**
