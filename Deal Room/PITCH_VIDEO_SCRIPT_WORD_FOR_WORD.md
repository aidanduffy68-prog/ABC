# 1-Minute Pitch Video Script (Word-for-Word)

## Option 1: Recommended (165 words, ~1 minute)

Genesis Mission just launched—the largest AI infrastructure deployment in government history. When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer.

Today's solutions are data vendors. They provide analytics, but agencies still rely on manual analyst reports that take 14+ days. They're subjective, unverifiable, and result in inter-agency disputes with no way to resolve them.

We built the first sovereign oracle for intelligence. Just like Polymarket uses UMA to resolve prediction markets, we provide cryptographically verifiable intelligence assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. That's a 98.9% reduction from traditional 14-day analysis. No political bias. Instant consensus.

We just completed our first threat intelligence compilation for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure—88% risk score, hash verified. Genesis Mission creates exactly the coordination problem our oracle solves.

We're industrializing America's crypto intelligence industry. Welcome to on-chain warfare's industrial age. Let's talk.

## Option 2: Slightly Faster (150 words, ~55 seconds)

Genesis Mission just launched. When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer.

Current solutions take 14+ days. They're subjective, unverifiable. Data vendors provide analytics, but they don't resolve disputes.

We built the sovereign oracle for intelligence. Cryptographically verifiable assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. Instant consensus. No political bias. We're the UMA Oracle for sovereign intelligence—same trustless model that DeFi uses, applied to national security.

We just demonstrated this for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure. 88% risk score, hash verified, compiled in under 500 milliseconds. Genesis Mission needs exactly this.

We're industrializing America's crypto intelligence industry. The sovereign oracle for truth in economic defense. Let's connect.

## Option 3: Most Conversational (160 words, ~1 minute)

Genesis Mission just launched—the largest AI infrastructure in government. When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer.

Today's solutions are data vendors like Chainalysis and TRM. They provide analytics, but agencies still use manual analyst reports that take 14+ days. They're subjective, unverifiable, and agencies can't reach consensus.

We built the first sovereign oracle for intelligence. Cryptographically verifiable threat assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. No political bias. Instant consensus. We're applying the DeFi oracle model—the same one that powers Polymarket—to intelligence disputes.

We just completed our first compilation for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure. 88% risk score, hash verified, compiled in under half a second. This is what Genesis Mission needs.

Welcome to on-chain warfare's industrial age. Let's talk.

## Reading Tips:

**Pacing:**
- Read at normal conversational pace (~150-165 words per minute)
- Pause briefly after key numbers: "500 milliseconds" (pause) "88% risk score" (pause)
- Emphasize: "first sovereign oracle," "98.9% reduction," "instant consensus"

**Tone:**
- Confident but not rushed
- Natural pauses for emphasis
- Clear articulation of numbers and technical terms

**Recommended:** Option 1 - Best balance of detail and pacing for exactly 1 minute.
