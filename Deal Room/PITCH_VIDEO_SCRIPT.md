# 1-Minute Pitch Video Script

## Option 1: Problem-Solution-Proof (Recommended)

**[0:00-0:10] Hook:**
Genesis Mission just launched—the largest AI infrastructure deployment in government history. When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer.

**[0:10-0:25] Problem:**
Today's solutions are data vendors. They provide analytics, but agencies still rely on manual analyst reports that take 14+ days. They're subjective, unverifiable, and result in inter-agency disputes with no way to resolve them.

**[0:25-0:45] Solution:**
We built the first sovereign oracle for intelligence. Just like Polymarket uses UMA to resolve prediction markets, we provide cryptographically verifiable intelligence assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. That's a 98.9% reduction from traditional 14-day analysis. No political bias. Instant consensus.

**[0:45-0:55] Proof:**
We just completed our first threat intelligence compilation for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure—88% risk score, hash verified. Genesis Mission creates exactly the coordination problem our oracle solves.

**[0:55-1:00] Call to Action:**
We're industrializing America's crypto intelligence industry. Welcome to on-chain warfare's industrial age. Let's talk.

## Option 2: Direct & Punchy

**[0:00-0:08] Hook:**
When government agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer. Genesis Mission just launched—the largest AI infrastructure in government. This is the problem we solve.

**[0:08-0:20] Problem:**
Current solutions take 14+ days. They're subjective, unverifiable, and agencies can't agree. Data vendors provide analytics, but they don't resolve disputes.

**[0:20-0:42] Solution:**
We built the sovereign oracle for intelligence. Cryptographically verifiable assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. That's instant consensus when agencies disagree. We're the UMA Oracle for sovereign intelligence—same trustless model that DeFi uses, applied to national security.

**[0:42-0:52] Proof:**
We just demonstrated this for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure. 88% risk score, compiled in under 500 milliseconds, hash verified. Genesis Mission needs exactly this.

**[0:52-1:00] Call to Action:**
We're industrializing America's crypto intelligence industry. The sovereign oracle for truth in economic defense. Let's connect.

## Option 3: Story-Driven

**[0:00-0:12] Hook:**
Genesis Mission just launched. Multiple agencies. Public-private partnerships. International collaboration. When they disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer.

**[0:12-0:24] Problem:**
Traditional intelligence analysis takes 14+ days. It's subjective, unverifiable, and agencies can't reach consensus. Data vendors like Chainalysis and TRM provide analytics, but they don't solve the dispute resolution problem.

**[0:24-0:44] Solution:**
We built the first sovereign oracle for intelligence. Cryptographically verifiable threat assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. No political bias. Instant consensus. We're applying the DeFi oracle model—the same one that powers Polymarket—to intelligence disputes.

**[0:44-0:54] Proof:**
We just completed our first compilation for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure. 88% risk score, hash verified, compiled in under half a second. This is what Genesis Mission needs.

**[0:54-1:00] Call to Action:**
Welcome to on-chain warfare's industrial age. Let's talk.

## Option 4: Most Concise

**[0:00-0:10] Hook:**
Genesis Mission just launched. When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer.

**[0:10-0:22] Problem:**
Current solutions take 14+ days. They're subjective, unverifiable. Data vendors provide analytics, but they don't resolve disputes.

**[0:22-0:40] Solution:**
We built the sovereign oracle for intelligence. Cryptographically verifiable assessments in less than 500 milliseconds. Instant consensus. No political bias. The UMA Oracle for sovereign intelligence.

**[0:40-0:50] Proof:**
We just demonstrated this for Department of War and DHS AI infrastructure. 88% risk score, hash verified, under 500 milliseconds.

**[0:50-1:00] Call to Action:**
We're industrializing America's crypto intelligence industry. Welcome to on-chain warfare's industrial age. Let's connect.
