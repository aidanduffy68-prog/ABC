# LinkedIn Post: Threat Intel Compilation

We just completed our first threat intelligence compilation using GH Systems ABC Sovereign Oracle.

**What it is:** Think security audit, but for intelligence. We compile behavioral patterns, coordination networks, and threat indicators into actionable assessments—in <500ms instead of 14+ days.

**Why Department of War first?** DoW (formerly DoD) operates the most complex AI infrastructure in government. When agencies disagree on threat assessments, there's no objective truth layer. We're demonstrating the sovereign oracle that resolves those disputes.

**Results:** 88% risk score for DoW & DHS AI infrastructure. Identified 3 threat indicators and coordination patterns across 3 systems. Cryptographically verifiable. No political bias. Instant consensus.
