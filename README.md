## ⚖️ Truth Verification for Post-AGI Intelligence

**GH Systems ABC is the oracle that verifies truth when AGI generates threat assessments.**

When agencies disagree (CIA: 85%, DHS: 60%) and AI-generated intelligence makes verification impossible, **GH Systems ABC provides cryptographically verifiable assessments in <500ms** — the objective truth layer for post-AGI intelligence operations.

**The Genesis Mission** creates the largest AI infrastructure deployment in government history, where this verification problem emerges at scale. **We're building the UMA for intelligence verification.**

**Recent Deployments:** Department of War & DHS (88% risk), Treasury (85% risk) — both compiled in <500ms with cryptographic proof.

**[🎯 Get Started: Reach Your Magic Moment in 60 Seconds](GETTING_STARTED.md)**

**The Magic Moment:** Successfully compile intelligence in <500ms and see the cryptographic proof. Get there in 60 seconds: `git clone https://github.com/aidanduffy68-prog/ABC.git && cd ABC && pip install -r requirements.txt && bash scripts/instant_demo.sh`
