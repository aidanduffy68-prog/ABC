## ⚖️ Chain-Agnostic Oracle for Post-AGI Intelligence

**GH Systems ABC is the chain-agnostic oracle that verifies truth when AGI generates threat assessments.**

When agencies disagree (CIA: 85%, DHS: 60%) and AI-generated intelligence makes verification impossible, **ABC provides cryptographically verifiable assessments in <500ms** — the objective truth layer for post-AGI intelligence operations.

**Chain-Agnostic Architecture** — ABC works with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, or any supported blockchain. **We focus on verification, not blockchain infrastructure.** Agencies choose their preferred chain; we provide the oracle.

**Built on Palantir Foundry** — Intelligence verification layer integrating with Foundry datasets for real-time analytics and cryptographically verifiable assessments.

**Aligned with National Security Strategy 2025** — Supports AI dominance (Genesis Mission), economic security, cybersecurity, and sovereignty priorities.

**Recent Deployments:** Department of War & DHS (88% risk), Treasury (85% risk) — compiled in <500ms with cryptographic proof.

**[🎯 Get Started: Magic Moment in 60 Seconds](GETTING_STARTED.md)** — `git clone https://github.com/aidanduffy68-prog/ABC.git && cd ABC && pip install -r requirements.txt && bash scripts/instant_demo.sh`
