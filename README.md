## ⚖️ Truth Verification for Post-AGI Intelligence

**GH Systems ABC is the oracle that verifies truth when AGI generates threat assessments.**

When agencies disagree (CIA: 85%, DHS: 60%) and AI-generated intelligence makes verification impossible, **GH Systems ABC provides cryptographically verifiable assessments in <500ms** — the objective truth layer for post-AGI intelligence operations.

**The Genesis Mission** creates the largest AI infrastructure deployment in government history, where this verification problem emerges at scale. **We're building the UMA for intelligence verification.**

**Recent Deployments:** Department of War & DHS (88% risk), Treasury (85% risk) — both compiled in <500ms with cryptographic proof.
