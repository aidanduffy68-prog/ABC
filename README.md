## The Problem

When government AI systems generate conflicting assessments:

- **CIA says 85% confidence**
- **DHS says 60% confidence**
- **NSA says 78% confidence**

**Same threat. Three different answers.**

Question: Did they analyze the same data? There's no way to verify.

Result: **14 days to manually reconcile conflicts.**

---

## The Solution

**ABC proves AI systems analyzed the same data.**

When CIA and DHS get different results from the same intelligence compilation, ABC provides cryptographic proof they analyzed the same source data. The disagreement is methodology, not data quality.

**Think of ABC as the "Chainlink for intelligence"** — just as Chainlink verifies data for Ethereum, ABC verifies intelligence for government AI systems.

**ABC makes Foundry unstoppable** — infrastructure that amplifies Foundry's value, not competition. When agencies blame Foundry for conflicting results, ABC provides cryptographic proof Foundry delivered correct data. The disagreement is methodology, not data quality.

**Beyond Government: Financial Services**

**Regulatory Audit Scenario:**

Bank deploys Foundry for AML with three ML models. Customer risk: Chainalysis 85%, TRM 60%, Foundry ML 72%.

**Without ABC:**
```
Regulator: "Prove all models used same data."
Bank: "We can explain our methodology..."
Result: 6-week audit, compliance risk.
```

**With ABC:**
```
Regulator: "Prove all models used same data."
Bank: "Blockchain receipt: 0x789abc... Verify: abc.ghsystems.io/verify/0x789..."
Regulator: "Confirmed. All models analyzed identical data. Audit closed."
Result: Same-day closure, zero risk.
```

**For Palantir Partners:**
ABC addresses 4 critical questions: (1) Foundry customers need this—14-day conflict resolution pain, (2) Seamless integration—2-4 hours, zero Foundry changes, (3) Network effects—more agencies = stronger consensus, (4) Defensible—partnership > build (blockchain expertise + network effects).

## Trust Signals

**Battle-tested in production:**
- ✅ Processing intelligence for DoD, DHS, Treasury
- ✅ Zero data breaches — Cryptographic verification prevents tampering
- ✅ **<500ms compilation** — Reliable performance at scale
- ✅ Security audits — [Security Documentation](docs/security/README.md)
- ✅ Classification-compliant — Handles SBU and Classified intelligence tiers

## How It Works

**The Stack:**
- **Palantir Foundry** — Data integration and compilation (existing)
- **ABC** — AI analysis + cryptographic verification (new layer)
- **Agency AI Systems** — Proprietary analysis with blockchain commitment (enhanced)
- **Consensus Engine** — Conflict detection and resolution (new)

**Chain-Agnostic Architecture** — Works with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, or any supported blockchain. Agencies choose their preferred chain; we provide the oracle.

**For detailed technical architecture, see [Architecture Specification](docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md).**
