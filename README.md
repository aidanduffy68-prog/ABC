## ⚖️ The Sovereign Oracle

**GH Systems ABC is the sovereign oracle for government AI security** — actively securing Department of War, DHS, and Treasury AI infrastructure through real-time threat intelligence compilations.

With the **Genesis Mission** launching the largest AI infrastructure deployment in government history, agencies need an objective truth layer for threat assessments. **GH Systems ABC delivers cryptographically verifiable intelligence in <500ms** (vs. 14+ days traditional), providing instant consensus when agencies disagree.

**Recent Deployments:** Department of War & DHS (88% risk), Treasury (85% risk) — both compiled in <500ms with cryptographic proof.
